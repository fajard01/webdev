    This website aims to utilize different techniques and materials
    from the Coursera class Responsive Web Design. As in class, it uses the bootstrap
    library for ready-made formatting, and JQuery to provide responsive
    functionality. The alien graphics have been developed by myself using Inkscape
    as my SVG editor and GIMP as the final renderer. There are a couple of images
    from the internet and I thank them to whoever they belong and apologize for
    not acknowleging them individually properly.

             First plan is to create a slideshow of aliens as a greeting to the page.
             I first place these images in a container and using css fixed positioned them on the central 
             part of the page. The <div> id will be used to loop them later.
